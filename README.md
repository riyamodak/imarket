# iMarket App - Production Interview

## About

Hey! Welcome to iMarket - the iOS app I made for my App Team Carolina Production Interview. The app allows users to browse and search for products in the market, save them to their favorited items, and add to cart for easy checkout. 

### **Required Features**

- The user should be on “Products” tab when they first open the app and see a list of all products, each showing key product details like title, price, category, and thumbnail, as well as a “Add to Cart” and a heart button.
- The user should be able to use the search bar to filter products on the “Products” tab.
- The user should be able to click the “Add to Cart” button on a product. This will add the product to the list in the “Cart” tab.
- Implement a user-friendly and responsive UI, closely resembling the design provided. The app should work in both light and dark mode.

### **Extra Features**

- Added a favorites feature, enabling users to bookmark products they are interested in.
- Shows the number of items in the cart as a badge on the “Cart” tab icon.
- Shows a cost breakdown in the “Cart” tab that shows the total price, the subtotal, taxes, etc.
- Added functionality for users to remove items from their cart.
